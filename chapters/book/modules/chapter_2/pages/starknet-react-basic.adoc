[id="starknet-react-basic"]

= Starknet React: A basic full example.


This tutorial will teach you how to build an ERC20 smart contract in Cairo and integrate it into a React web application using StarkNet React. You will learn how to implement the ERC20 interface, deploy your contract to the StarkNet network, and interact with your contract from your React application. By following this tutorial, you will be able to create your own ERC20 token and deploy it to StarkNet.

This tutorial is suitable for beginners with a basic knowledge of Cairo programming language and ReactJS. You will also need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your machine.

We'll create an ERC20 token named MKT and build a web3 interface to interact with it, providing functionalities like checking the balance and transferring tokens.

image::basic_dapp_screenshot.png[screenshot]

Along this tutorial, we will be using the following tools and libraries:

- Scarb 0.7.0 with Cairo 2.2.0
- Starkli 0.1.9
- Oppenzeppelin libraries v0.7.0
- Starknet React v1.0.4
- NodeJS v19.6.1
- Next.js 13.1.6
- Visual Studio Code
- Vercel

== Create a new StarkNet project

First, let's create a new StarkNet project named "erc20" using Scarb:

[source,bash]
----
~$ mkdir erc20
~$ cd erc20
~/erc20$ scarb init --name erc20
Created package.
~/erc20$
----

Edit your Scarb.toml and add the necessary OpenZeppelin libraries. Your Scarb.toml file should resemble the following:

[source,rust]
----
[package]
name = "erc20"
version = "0.1.0"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
starknet = ">=2.2.0"
openzeppelin = { git = "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin-contracts.git", tag = "v0.7.0" }

[[target.starknet-contract]]
----

== Implement the ERC20 token

Now, create a new file named src/erc20.cairo where we will define our ERC20 token, MKT, and its functions for checking the balance and transferring tokens:

[source,rust]
----
#[starknet::contract]
mod erc20 {
    use starknet::ContractAddress;
    use openzeppelin::token::erc20::ERC20;

    #[storage]
    struct Storage {}

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(
        ref self: ContractState,
        initial_supply: u256,
        recipient: ContractAddress
    ) {
        let name = 'MyToken';
        let symbol = 'MTK';

        let mut unsafe_state = ERC20::unsafe_new_contract_state();
        ERC20::InternalImpl::initializer(ref unsafe_state, name, symbol);
        ERC20::InternalImpl::_mint(ref unsafe_state, recipient, initial_supply);
    }

    #[external(v0)]
    #[generate_trait]
    impl Ierc20Impl of Ierc20 {
        fn balance_of(self: @ContractState, account: ContractAddress) -> u256 {
            let unsafe_state = ERC20::unsafe_new_contract_state();
            ERC20::ERC20Impl::balance_of(@unsafe_state, account)
        }

        fn transfer(ref self: ContractState, recipient: ContractAddress, amount: u256) -> bool {
            let mut unsafe_state = ERC20::unsafe_new_contract_state();
            ERC20::ERC20Impl::transfer(ref unsafe_state, recipient, amount)
        }
    }
}
----

image::basic_dapp_erc20.png[screenshot]

Once you've written your contract, compile it with Scarb:

[source,yaml]
----
~/erc20$ scarb build
    Updating git repository https://github.com/openzeppelin-contracts
   Compiling erc20 v0.1.0 (/home/kali/erc20/Scarb.toml)
    Finished release target(s) in 6 seconds
~/erc20$
----

Afterward, declare your smart contract on Starknet testnet:

[source,yaml]
----
~/erc20$ starkli declare target/dev/erc20_erc20.sierra.json --account ../../demo-account.json --keystore ../../demo-key.json --compiler-version 2.1.0 --network goerli-1 --watch

~/erc20$
----

== Deploy your ERC20 contract

Now, let's deploy the MKT Token using Starkli. You'll need to provide the following arguments:

- `Initial mint`: We will mint 1,000,000 tokens, but since our MKT token has 18 decimals (OpenZeppelin default), we need to pass 1,000,000 * 10^18 = 0xd3c21bcecceda1000000. Also, as our contract expects a u256 mint value, we need to pass two values for low and high values: 0xd3c21bcecceda1000000 0.
- `Receiver address`: You can use your own address. In this example, we will use: 0x0334863e3e851de87fb4b6b6113aa2a6b40ea20f22dbec55536e4eac912206fc

[source,yaml]
----

[NOTE]
====
You will receive a different deployed address; keep this address to replace it in the next section's TypeScript files with your contract address.
====

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed your Cairo ERC20 smart contract on Starknet..

== Install the StarkNet React library

With your contract deployed, it's time to start building your web application. First, install the Starknet React library:

[source,bash]
----

Edit erc20_web/index.tsx and replace its contents with the provided code:

[source,typescript]
----
import Head from 'next/head'
import { useBlock } from '@starknet-react/core'
import WalletBar from '../components/WalletBar'
import { BlockTag } from 'starknet';

export default function Home() {
  const { data, isLoading, isError } = useBlock({
    refetchInterval: 3000,
    blockIdentifier: BlockTag.latest,
  })
  return (
    <>

        </div>
        <WalletBar />
      </main>
    </>
  )
}
----

Run your installed web3 default application:

[source,bash]

== Add functionality to your React application

Now, we will create two components for balance and transfer and update Wallet.tsx to add our new functionality:

image::basic_dapp_react_files.png[screenshot]

Create a balance component in components/Balance.tsx and include this code:

[source,typescript]
----
import { useAccount, useContractRead } from "@starknet-react/core";
import erc20ABI from '../assets/erc20.json';

function Balance() {
  const { address } = useAccount()
  const { data, isLoading, error, refetch } = useContractRead({
    address: '0x001892d81e09cb2c2005f0112891dacb92a6f8ce571edd03ed1f3e549abcf37f',
    abi: erc20ABI,
    functionName: 'balance_of',
    args: [address],
    watch: false
  })

  if (isLoading) return <span>Loading...</span>
  if (error) return <span>Error: {JSON.stringify(error)}</span>

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Balance.</p>
      <p>{data?data.toString(): 0} </p>
      <p><button onClick={refetch}>Get Balance</button></p>
      <hr/>
    </div>
  )
}
  

export default Balance; 
----

[NOTE]
====
Replace address with your deployed contract address.
====

Create a transfer component in components/Transfer.tsx and include this code:

[source,typescript]
----
import { useAccount, useContractWrite } from "@starknet-react/core";
import React, { useState, useMemo } from "react";

function Transfer() {
    const { address } = useAccount()
    const [count] = useState(1)
    const [recipient, setRecipient] = useState('0x');
    const [amount, setAmount] = useState('1000000000000000000');
    
  
    const calls = useMemo(() => {
      const tx = {
        contractAddress: '0x001892d81e09cb2c2005f0112891dacb92a6f8ce571edd03ed1f3e549abcf37f',
        entrypoint: 'transfer',
        calldata: [recipient, amount, 0]
      }
      return Array(count).fill(tx)
    }, [address, count, recipient, amount])
  
    const { write } = useContractWrite({ calls })
    
    const handleRecipientChange = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
      setRecipient(event.target.value);
    };
    
    const handleAmountChange = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
        setAmount(event.target.value);
    };
  
    return (
      <>
        <p>Transfer.</p>
        <p>Recipient:
            <input
            type="text"
            value={recipient}
            onChange={handleRecipientChange}
            />
        </p>
        <p>Amount (default 1 MKT with 18 decimals):
          <input
          type="number"
          value={amount}
          onChange={handleAmountChange}
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          <button onClick={() => write()}>Write</button>
        </p>
        <hr/>
      </>
    )
}

export default Transfer; 
----
[NOTE]
====
Replace contractAddress with your deployed contract address.
====

Finally, edit components/Wallet.tsx and replace the existing code with this new code:

[source,typescript]
----
import { useAccount, useConnectors } from '@starknet-react/core'
import { useMemo } from 'react'
import Balance from '../components/Balance'
import Transfer from '../components/Transfer'

function WalletConnected() {
  const { address } = useAccount()
  const { disconnect } = useConnectors()

  const shortenedAddress = useMemo(() => {
    if (!address) return ''
    return `${address.slice(0, 6)}...${address.slice(-4)}`
  }, [address])

  return (
    <div>
      <span>Connected: {shortenedAddress}</span>
      <p><button onClick={disconnect}>Disconnect</button></p>
      <hr/>
      <Balance />
      <Transfer />
    </div>
  )
}

function ConnectWallet() {
  const { connectors, connect } = useConnectors()

  return (
    <div>
      <span>Choose a wallet:</span>
      <p>
      {connectors.map((connector) => {
        return (
          <button key={connector.id} onClick={() => connect(connector)}>
            {connector.id}
          </button>
        )
      })}
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default function WalletBar() {
  const { address } = useAccount()

  return address ? <WalletConnected /> : <ConnectWallet />
}
----

Our application is almost ready, but we need one more file: the ABI file for our MKT token. To create it, follow these steps:

1. Create an assets/ folder at the root of your project.
2. Add an empty assets/erc20.json file.
3. Navigate to your previous ERC20 Cairo folder and open erc20/target/erc20_erc20_sierra.json.

image::basic_dapp_abi.png[screenshot]

4. Copy the ABI definition (including square brackets) and paste it into assets/erc20.json:

image::basic_dapp_abi_new.png[screenshot]

Congratulations! You now have a basic MKT token application running locally at http://localhost:3000 (or the port previously used by the server). With this application, you can connect your wallet, check your balance, and transfer tokens to your friends.

image::basic_dapp_localhost.png[screenshot]

== Publish your project to Internet

But what if you want to transfer tokens to your friends, and they want to check their balances and make transfers too? Our last step is to publish our application on the internet so anyone can use it. To do this, we will use Vercel:

1. Create your own account at https://vercel.com/signup[Vercel Signup]

2. Install Vercel in your web application folder (erc20_web):

[source,yarn]
----
~$ cd erc20_web/
~/erc20_web$ npm i -g vercel

== Conclusion

In this tutorial, you've embarked on a journey to create a web3 application using React and StarkNet Cairo, building an ERC20 smart contract and integrating it into a user-friendly web interface. Here's a brief summary of what you've accomplished:

`Project Setup`: You learned how to set up a new StarkNet project using Scarb, ensuring the inclusion of OpenZeppelin libraries.

`ERC20 Implementation`: You implemented an ERC20 token contract in Cairo, adding functions to check balances and transfer tokens. This contract was compiled and deployed on the StarkNet network.

`React Integration`: With the contract deployed, you created a React web application using StarkNet React, including components for balance checking and token transfers.

`ABI Definition`: You generated the ABI (Application Binary Interface) definition for your MKT token, which is essential for interacting with the contract.

`Publication to the Internet`: To make your application accessible to a broader audience, you deployed it to the internet using Vercel, enabling users to connect their wallets, check balances, and make token transfers.

This tutorial has provided you with a foundation for building web3 applications using StarkNet, React, and Cairo-based smart contracts. The skills you've gained can be extended to create more complex decentralized applications and smart contracts. The world of decentralized finance and blockchain technology awaits your innovative contributions, and you now have the knowledge to get started. Happy coding!
